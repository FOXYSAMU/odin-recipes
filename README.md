My first project in TOP, in it I will build a really basic recipe website only made with HTML.
Im really excited to start and I think it won't be  too difficult. 

I'll see...

Update 1:
This first part was pretty easy, I made the index and I added the first recipe which is the lasagna.

Im really having fun with this project. 

The only thing left to do is add two recipes more.
